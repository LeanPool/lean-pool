# Second-order definability with bounded alternation

Foundation for *defining* the levels `Σₖ`/`Πₖ` (`k ≥ 1`) of the polynomial
hierarchy logically, by Fagin's ([Fagin 1974][fagin1974generalized]) and
Stockmeyer's ([Stockmeyer 1976][stockmeyer1976polynomial]) theorems: `Σₖᵖ`
consists of
the problems definable by a second-order sentence with `k` alternating blocks
of second-order quantifiers starting existentially – on unordered finite
structures (the first existential block can guess a linear order, so the
order-free definition is equivalent to the classical ordered one).

No object-level second-order syntax is needed: a second-order quantifier
block (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock`) is a finite family of relation variables with
given arities, its instantiations are Lean-level (`SOBlock.structure` turns
an assignment of relations into a structure over the block's vocabulary
`SOBlock.lang`), and only the first-order kernel is object-level – a sentence
over the base language expanded by all blocks (`DescriptiveComplexity.soLang`).
`DescriptiveComplexity.SORealize` evaluates the alternating quantification, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable` / `DescriptiveComplexity.PiSODefinable` state that a
decision problem is defined by such a sentence *on nonempty finite
structures*.

This file proves the two structural facts about these notions that do not
involve reductions:

* isomorphism-invariance (`DescriptiveComplexity.sorealize_iso`) – so second-order
  definable properties are bona fide decision problems;
* the duality `Πₖ = co-Σₖ` (`DescriptiveComplexity.piSODefinable_iff_compl`), by
  negating the kernel and flipping the quantifiers.

The rest of the definitional theory lives in dedicated files: functoriality
and padding in `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderLift`, closure under FO reductions in
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderPull`, closure under ordered FO reductions in
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderOrdered`, and the resulting definition of the levels
`Σₖᵖ`/`Πₖᵖ` for `k ≥ 1` in `DescriptiveComplexity.Hierarchy`.

/-! ### Atoms in the relation variables of a block

The clausal fragments of existential second-order logic – SO-Horn
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderHorn`) and SO-Krom
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderKrom`) – represent their first-order kernel as
data: a list of clauses built from *atoms* in the quantified relation
variables, over a shared list of universally quantified first-order variables.
The atom type and its semantics are common to both fragments, so they live
here. -/
